*Abstract:* Despite being the most common initial attack
vector, document-based malware delivery remains understudied compared to research on malicious executables. The
focus on analyzing executables limits our understanding of
how attackers leverage document file formats and exploit
their functionalities for malicious purposes. In this paper,
we perform a measurement study that leverages existing
tools and techniques to detect, extract, and analyze malicious Office documents. We collect a substantial dataset of
9,086 malicious samples and reveal a critical gap in the
understanding of how attackers utilize these documents.
Our in-depth analysis highlights emerging tactics used in
both targeted and large-scale cyberattacks while identifying
weaknesses in common document analysis methods. Through
a combination of analysis techniques, we gain crucial insights valuable for forensic analysts to assess suspicious files,
pinpoint infection origins, and ultimately contribute to the
development of more robust detection models. We make our
dataset and source code available to the academic community
to foster further research in this area.
